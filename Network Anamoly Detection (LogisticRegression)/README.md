Sure! Here's a README file for the "Network Anomaly Detection" project, following the style of your provided README:

# Network Anomaly Detection

This project implements a machine learning system to detect anomalies in network traffic. The project explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to achieve this goal.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the KDDCUP'99 dataset, which is widely used for network-based anomaly detection systems. The dataset contains 125,973 entries.

### Dataset Statistics:
- The dataset is imbalanced, with more normal traffic than attack traffic.
- Various features have different scales and distributions.

## Steps

### 1. Data Analysis and Exploration
- **Visualization**: Used heatmaps to analyze feature correlations.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarized key statistics for numerical features.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Dropped irrelevant columns (`land`, `urgent`, `numfailedlogins`, `numoutboundcmds`).
- Converted categorical features to numerical using Label Encoding.
- Scaled features using MinMaxScaler.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Computed correlation matrix to understand feature relationships.
- Selected relevant features for model training.

### 4. Model Training
Implemented a **Logistic Regression** classifier:
- Trained using 75% of the dataset.
- Tested on 25%, achieving an accuracy of **97.62%**.

### 5. Hyperparameter Optimization
- Used GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for Logistic Regression.
- Achieved improved accuracy of **97.84%** with optimized parameters.

## Prerequisites

### Python Libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`
- `pickle`

### Dataset
The dataset should be available in the `dataset/` folder with the file names `Train.txt` and `Test.txt`.

## Results

| Metric          | Value    |
|------------------|----------|
| Accuracy         | 97.84%  |
| Precision        | 98.31%  |
| Recall           | 97.64%  |

## Model Saving and Loading

The trained model and scaler are saved using `pickle` for future use. The files are:
- `anomaly_detector.pkl`
- `anomaly_scaler.pkl`

You can load these files to make predictions on new data.
