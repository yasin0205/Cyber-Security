# Malware Detection

This project implements a machine learning system to classify Portable Executable (PE) files as either **benign** or **malicious**. The project explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to achieve this goal.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains 19,611 PE files, with the following columns:

- Various features extracted from the PE headers and sections.
- `Malware`: The class of the file (`0` for benign, `1` for malicious).

### Dataset Statistics:
- The dataset includes 79 features extracted from each PE file.
- Class distribution is imbalanced, with more benign files than malicious ones.

## Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Visualization**: Used histograms to analyze the distribution of features.
- **Feature Analysis**:
  - Examined the distribution of key features for benign and malicious files.
  - Identified correlations between features.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Dropped irrelevant columns (`Name`, `Machine`, `TimeDateStamp`, `SectionMainChar`).
- Scaled features using MinMaxScaler to normalize the data.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Selected relevant features for training the model.
- Produced a scaled feature matrix for model input.

### 4. Model Training
Implemented three classifiers:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Each model was trained using 80% of the dataset and tested on 20%.

### 5. Model Evaluation
Evaluated the models using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics:
- **Logistic Regression**: Accuracy: 95%, Precision: 95%, Recall: 95%
- **Random Forest**: Accuracy: 99%, Precision: 99%, Recall: 99%
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: Accuracy: 97%, Precision: 97%, Recall: 97%

## Prerequisites

### Python Libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`

### Dataset
The dataset should be available in the `dataset/` folder with the file name `dataset_malwares.csv`.

## Results

| Metric          | Logistic Regression | Random Forest | K-Nearest Neighbors |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Accuracy        | 95%                 | 99%           | 97%                  |
| Precision       | 95%                 | 99%           | 97%                  |
| Recall          | 95%                 | 99%           | 97%                  |
